# Multi-Modal Earnings Call Forecaster

An innovative system that predicts post-earnings call stock volatility by fusing linguistic and vocal features from quarterly earnings calls. This project goes beyond simple sentiment analysis to incorporate advanced NLP techniques and audio biomarker analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Modal Data Analysis
- **Textual Analysis**: Advanced NLP techniques including uncertainty detection, forward-looking statement analysis, and topic modeling
- **Audio Analysis**: Vocal biomarker extraction (pitch, jitter, shimmer, speech rate) for confidence and stress detection
- **Feature Fusion**: Combines text and audio features into a unified prediction model

### 2. Advanced NLP Capabilities
- Financial lexicon analysis (Loughran-McDonald dictionary)
- Readability and complexity metrics
- Forward-looking statement detection
- Topic modeling on Q&A sections
- Executive sentiment quantification

### 3. Audio Processing
- Vocal pitch analysis and variation detection
- Jitter and shimmer measurements for deception detection
- Speech rate analysis
- Speaker separation and identification

### 4. Machine Learning & Explainability
- XGBoost model for volatility prediction
- SHAP-based explainable AI
- Interactive dashboard with real-time predictions
- Feature importance visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Data Collection**:
```bash
python src/data_acquisition/scraper.py --companies AAPL MSFT GOOGL
```

2. **Feature Extraction**:
```bash
python src/feature_engineering/extract_features.py
```

streamlit run src/visualization/dashboard.py
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.modeling.predictor import EarningsCallPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = EarningsCallPredictor()

# Predict volatility for a new earnings call
prediction = predictor.predict(
    transcript_path="path/to/transcript.txt",
    audio_path="path/to/audio.wav"
)

print(f"Predicted volatility: {prediction['volatility']}")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction['confidence']}")
```

### Advanced Analysis
```python
from src.text_analysis.analyzer import TextAnalyzer
from src.audio_analysis.analyzer import AudioAnalyzer

# Text analysis
text_analyzer = TextAnalyzer()
text_features = text_analyzer.extract_features(transcript)

# Audio analysis
audio_analyzer = AudioAnalyzer()
audio_features = audio_analyzer.extract_features(audio_file)

# Combine features
combined_features = text_features + audio_features
```
